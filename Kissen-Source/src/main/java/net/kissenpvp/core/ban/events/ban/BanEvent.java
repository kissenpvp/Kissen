/**
 * The {@link BanEvent} class defines the events that are triggered when a {@link AbstractBanTemplate} is enacted.
 * It extends {@link EventClass} which specifies that this class defines an event occurrence in a system,
 * and implements {@link Cancellable} which specifies that this event can be cancel.
 * <p>
 * The {@link BanEvent} class is parameterized with a subclass of {@link AbstractBanTemplate}, which represents a specific type of ban.
 * This class provides methods for getting and setting the ban that the event is related to, as well as a method for cancelling the event.
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates a ban event and provides a way to interact with the event controller,
 * allowing other components of the system to cancel the event or manipulate the corresponding ban object.
 * <p>
 * This class should be used in conjunction with the {@link AbstractBanTemplate} class, which represents a single ban,
 * and the {@link EventClass} and {@link Cancellable} interfaces, which provide the necessary functionalities for defining and manipulating events.
 * <p>
 * This class has {@link Getter} and {@link Setter} annotations, indicating that getter and setter methods are autogenerated by the Lombok library.
